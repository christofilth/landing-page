# Project: Landing Page 
For The Odin Project's foundations course


## Introduction
For this project I am creating a web page based on a design from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). I should complete the project using the skills I have learned so far in HTML and CSS. The Odin Project provided the following image to use as reference:

They also provided the following image to use colour and fonts:
